Protests have escalated across the country over the right to freedom of choice, fuelled by an underlying discontent over the state of the country. Stasis Consulting, a U.S. based opinion research firm, caught a snapshot of sentiments in Iran in July 2022, just prior to the election of newly incumbent President Ebrahim Raisi. It reveals how, only a few months ago, tensions had already been mounting. According to the survey, 77 percent of Iranians thought that the country\u2019s youth do not see prosperity in their futures. For the group aged 18-29 years old, this was even more pronounced, rising to 80 percent. At the same time, nearly half (49 percent) of the age group said that if they had the opportunity to move abroad they would, with Germany as the first choice of destination, followed by Canada and the U.S.When asked about the main reasons Iranians have left the country in recent years, 57 percent of respondents said it was due to economic problems. However, 26 percent also said political or religious freedom was a main factor, while 25 percent said it was to look for a better life and 19 percent cited dissatisfaction with government officials. Where half (52 percent) said they either completely or somewhat disliked President Raisi, he at least scored higher than former president Hassan Rouhani who had a favorability rate of only 24 percent. We can see that even back in July, many Iranians were skeptical of the government's choices. Where 50 percent of respondents said the proposed Regulatory System for Cyberspace Services Bill, was being introduced purely for censorship reasons, only 18 percent said it was intended to merely maintain law-abiding use of the internet. Since Amini\u2019s death, WhatsApp and Instagram have been blocked.

As our chart shows, citizens tend to circumnavigate such crackdowns by downloading virtual private networks, or VPNs, which allows them to get around restrictions to certain blocked sites.

Yet, other countries too have seen surges this year. For instance, Sri Lanka saw a 17,000 percent increase in VPN downloads on April 3 2022, when social media platforms Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Instagram and WhatsApp were banned. The internet blackout came as the government enforced a curfew, attempting to keep protesters from hitting the streets over a disastrous economic downturn, mainly attributed to governmental mishandling, which led to major food and fuel shortages.Azerbaijan and Armenia, which saw clashes erupt on the border earlier this month, have also seen people on both sides of the border seek out VPNs this year, with an increase of 751 percent and 84 percent, respectively.

Thousands of pieces of debris from broken down satellites, rocket boosters and weapons tests that we\u2019ve launched over the years have got stuck in orbit, creating clutter, which could not only crash into the active satellites we need for monitoring the Earth but also release harmful chemicals into the atmosphere as they burn up on re-entry, depleting the ozone layer, as well as potentially creating problems for future launches and space exploration. As our chart shows, most space junk comes from three countries: Russia, the U.S. and China. Last November, Russia blew up one of its old satellites using an anti-satellite (ASAT) weapon, sending thousands of pieces of debris into orbit and risked hitting the International Space Station. The Secure World Foundation estimates at least 16 debris-creating ASAT weapons tests have been carried out to date, with the most potentially damaging carried out by China in 2007, as the country downed one of their own satellites, creating an estimated 3,000 pieces of debris. However, it was the U.S. that created the first ASAT test, back in the 1950s, and according to Data Center Dynamics, has since conducted at least three ASAT debris-creating tests; two in the mid-1980s and one in 2008.According to the OECD, active debris removal faces several \u201ctechnological, geopolitical and economic challenges.\u201d Manufacturing and launching debris removal vehicles is expensive and, if it goes wrong, there\u2019s the risk of simply creating further debris. On top of this, OECD analysts explain: \u201cthe retrieval of debris could involve sharing potentially sensitive data about the debris object\u2019s design that could involve national security, foreign policy, intellectual property, etc. Therefore, countries would realistically be limited to removing their own satellites or those of close military allies.\u201dDespite this, a number of space missions are planned over the next few years, including the European Space Agency\u2019s ClearSpace-1 and the Japanese Commercial Removal of Debris Demonstration (CRD2) mission. According to the OECD, possible solutions that are being worked on include space or ground based lasers to \u201cnudge\u201d objects out of the way, as well as the possibility to create an \u201cartificial atmosphere\u201d to divert its orbit. The organization\u2019s analysts conclude: \u201cAll legal, technological and economic hurdles aside, these approaches depend on a much more accurate capability of space situational awareness and space tracking than exists today.\u201dEvidently the issue of space debris will need to be solved soon as companies such as Boeing Co. and SpaceX get set to launch some 65,000 spacecraft into low-Earth orbit, upping the likelihood of more collisions and even further debris in the future.", "graphic": "data/media/28309.jpeg", "publishedDate": "2022-09-22", "tag": ""}, "28308": {"title": "From Sputnik to Starlink - Earth's Orbit is Getting Crowded", "body": "Satellite data and signals provide crucial inputs for many economic activities - but Earth's orbit is becoming increasingly crowded.

As our chart shows, there is also a disparity between jails and federal or state prisons. In the U.S, a jail is where people are held before they are sentenced in court. It is also a place where people are sent after receiving a sentence, usually for lighter crimes. A prison is where people go to carry out longer sentences. The gap in suicide rates comes down to a number of reasons. In a state prison, officials have more detailed information when trying to assess inmates for suicide risks and there is greater focus on educational programmes. By comparison, jails are considered to have worse conditions, uncertainty over pending sentences, and according to reporting in NPR, are more likely to receive first-time offenders who might experience a traumatic \u201cshock of confinement\u201d, as they are suddenly cut off from social support.Leah Wang of The Prison Policy Initiative writes that the increase of suicides in jails can also be mapped onto the rising number of women being incarcerated, often in rural, smaller jails. She adds that mental health issues and drug or alcohol disorders are significantly more likely among this group, although often not identified at the time, and that jails' policies do not reflect the needs of women. Wang writes: \u201cJails are shameful replacements for key social and medical services, and too often low-level offenses are used to justify locking people up, out of sight, when they simply need help.\u201dAs our chart shows, the suicide gap goes back at least two decades - when BJS reports on the topic first began - and is getting worse. And where federal and state prisons have had historically lower suicide rates than jails, their rates have been climbing in recent years too. Delays with data reporting mean we do not yet have the numbers on jail and prison suicides from 2020 to 2022. These will likely be impacted by the pandemic, whether through fears of the virus itself, the trauma of losing loved ones and fellow inmates, limited visiting times or with staffing shortages making it hard to monitor inmates.", "graphic": "data/media/28290.jpeg", "publishedDate": "2022-09-20", "tag": "Prisoners in the United States"}, "28287": {"title": "The Premier League's Youngest and Oldest", "body": "Ethan Nwaneri and Arsenal set a Premier League record on Sunday which is going to be difficult to beat.
