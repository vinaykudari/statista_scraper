Considering properties with 25 rooms or more, the number of independent hotels in Europe has dropped from just over 51 thousand in 2015 to 49,500 in 2021.

Protests have escalated across the country, fuelled by an underlying discontent over the state of the economy and stringent religious laws. Stasis Consulting, a U.S. based opinion research firm, caught a snapshot of sentiments in Iran in July 2022, just prior to the election of newly incumbent President Ebrahim Raisi. It reveals how, only a few months ago, tensions had already been mounting. According to the survey, 77 percent of Iranians thought that the country\u2019s youth do not see prosperity in their futures. For the group aged 18-29 years old, this was even more pronounced, rising to 80 percent. At the same time, nearly half (49 percent) of the age group said that if they had the opportunity to move abroad they would, with Germany as the first choice of destination, followed by Canada and the U.S.When asked about the main reasons Iranians have left the country in recent years, 57 percent of respondents said it was due to economic problems. However, 26 percent also said political or religious freedom was a main factor, while 25 percent said it was to look for a better life and 19 percent cited dissatisfaction with government officials. Where half (52 percent) said they either completely or somewhat disliked President Raisi, he at least scored higher than former president Hassan Rouhani who had a favorability rate of only 24 percent. We can see that even back in July, many Iranians were skeptical of the government tightening its hold over the country. Where 50 percent of respondents said the proposed Regulatory System for Cyberspace Services Bill, was being introduced purely for censorship reasons, only 18 percent said it was intended to merely maintain law-abiding use of the internet. Since Amini\u2019s death, WhatsApp and Instagram have been blocked. The country has also seen widespread internet outages as well as reports of the disconnection or slowing down of cell phone services. Meanwhile, Twitter and Facebook have both long been blocked in Iran.

More than 800 people were detained across 35 cities in Russia on Saturday alone, according to independent Russian human rights media project OVD-Info. Reports include that minors were among those detained. As our chart shows, the highest concentration of arrests took place in the capital of Moscow (399) followed by St. Petersburg (143), Novosibirsk (71), Perm (26) and Irkutsk (20). On Wednesday 21, the day Putin announced the new rules, OVD-Info recorded even more arrests - a total of 1,311 detentions across 38 cities. These included 502 people in Moscow and 524 in St Petersburg.According to Al Jazeera, tensions are especially high in poor ethnic-minority areas such as the southern Russian region of Dagestan, which has already lost a disproportionately large number of soldiers to the war in Ukraine. Protests have taken place routinely in Russia since the invasion of Ukraine, at great personal risk to individuals who are demonstrating.

From Thursday, however, Finland\u2019s border guard noticed that gradually more Russians were starting to make the crossing.According to the Finnish Border Guard\u2019s official Twitter account, at around the same time, misleading information had started to circulate on social media, including a video of a 35km long queue that had been filmed a long time before. They encouraged travelers to only use reliable sources of information, adding that everything at the border was under control.As our chart shows, peak figures were recorded on Saturday 24, with 8,572 Russians entering Finland and 4,199 entering Russia, marking the busiest weekend of the year so far. On Monday, the border guard\u2019s official Twitter account confirmed: \u201cTraffic is still busy, but reduced from the peak of the weekend. The majority of arrivals move on to other countries.\u201d While the uptick is largely being attributed to the conscription laws, a number of people are likely also holidaymakers as relaxed Covid restrictions on both sides of the border have increased travel, and will return again to Russia. Finland announced on Friday that they have plans to restrict the entry of Russian citizens and are still hammering out the details.

In 2019, Europe had reached an all-time high in terms of international visitors, receiving an unprecedented 579 million travelers that year. In 2020, European traveler numbers painted a very different picture, dropping to well under 200 million arrivals. By comparison, the SARS epidemic barely made a dent in 2003 and, although the global financial crisis was clearly responsible for a decrease in 2008 and 2009, this was nothing compared to the catastrophic fall in international arrivals Europe has seen in 2020.

And even though this one had been coming for a while, it still sent shockwaves through the (sporting) world. Roger Federer, one of the most successful and arguably the most popular tennis player of all time, announced his retirement. Plagued by injury for the last couple of years, Federer, who turned 41 last month, hasn\u2019t played a competitive match since Wimbledon 2021. His body had sent him a very clear message, Federer wrote in his retirement notice, and after working on a comeback for more than a year now, he finally decided to listen. \u201cI am 41 years old. I have played more than 1,500 matches over 24 years. Tennis has treated me more generously than I ever would have dreamt, and now I must recognize when it is time to end my competitive career,\u201d Federer wrote, adding that he would never fully leave the game of tennis.Federer looks back at a career full of records, some of which will likely last, while others have already been broken by his eternal rivals Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal. Tennis fans will certainly think back to the age of the \u201cBig Three\u201d for decades, as no other group of players has dominated the game for as long as these three have, and partly continue to do. The following chart sums up some of Federer\u2019s achievements and records, even though the complete list is far too long for a single infographic.", "graphic": "data/media/28270.jpeg", "publishedDate": "2022-09-16", "tag": "Tennis"}}
