Protests have escalated across the country, fuelled by an underlying discontent over the state of the economy and stringent religious laws. Stasis Consulting, a U.S. based opinion research firm, caught a snapshot of sentiments in Iran in July 2022, just prior to the election of newly incumbent President Ebrahim Raisi. It reveals how, only a few months ago, tensions had already been mounting. According to the survey, 77 percent of Iranians thought that the country\u2019s youth do not see prosperity in their futures. For the group aged 18-29 years old, this was even more pronounced, rising to 80 percent. At the same time, nearly half (49 percent) of the age group said that if they had the opportunity to move abroad they would, with Germany as the first choice of destination, followed by Canada and the U.S.When asked about the main reasons Iranians have left the country in recent years, 57 percent of respondents said it was due to economic problems. However, 26 percent also said political or religious freedom was a main factor, while 25 percent said it was to look for a better life and 19 percent cited dissatisfaction with government officials. Where half (52 percent) said they either completely or somewhat disliked President Raisi, he at least scored higher than former president Hassan Rouhani who had a favorability rate of only 24 percent. We can see that even back in July, many Iranians were skeptical of the government tightening its hold over the country. Where 50 percent of respondents said the proposed Regulatory System for Cyberspace Services Bill, was being introduced purely for censorship reasons, only 18 percent said it was intended to merely maintain law-abiding use of the internet. Since Amini\u2019s death, WhatsApp and Instagram have been blocked. The country has also seen widespread internet outages as well as reports of the disconnection or slowing down of cell phone services.

Internet shutdowns are fairly commonplace in authoritarian societies on the eve of change, where governments may seek to gain control of the narrative by trying to stop communication and the sharing of information which can fuel protests and uprisings. Afterall, the internet can be a powerful tool for social mobilization, as shown by the Arab Spring movement of uprisings which began in the early 2010s. As our chart shows, citizens tend to circumnavigate such crackdowns by downloading virtual private networks, or VPNs, which allows them to get around restrictions to certain blocked sites. These do not work, however, when countries shut off basic internet completely. In Iran, demand for VPN downloads increased by more than 3000 percent in September, according to TopVPN100.com. Yet, other countries too have seen surges this year. For instance, Sri Lanka saw a 17,000 percent increase in VPN downloads on April 3 2022, when social media platforms Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Instagram and WhatsApp were banned. The internet blackout came as the government enforced a curfew, attempting to keep protesters from hitting the streets over a disastrous economic downturn, mainly attributed to governmental mishandling, which led to major food and fuel shortages.Azerbaijan and Armenia, which saw clashes erupt on the border earlier this month, have also seen people on both sides of the border seek out VPNs this year, with an increase of 751 percent and 84 percent, respectively.

One conclusion from the researchers at University of Otago in New Zealand, having analyzed movies from 1962 to 2015, is that the secret agent did in fact have a severe drinking problem. Beyond figuring out that Bond met half the criteria for alcohol abuse disorder, the study looked at product placements in Bond films. The number of which appearing in Bond films has been steadily increasing decade by decade. In the 1960s, Bond films had an average of about 5 product placements per film, with barely any mention of alcohol brands. By the 2010s an average Bond film featured around 30 product placements per film, which can include anything from alcohol to cars. The amount of alcohol brands making an appearance has also increased significantly since 007 first hit our screens.", "graphic": "data/media/16434.jpeg", "publishedDate": "2022-09-29", "tag": "Movie industry in the U.S. & Canada"}, "11857": {"title": "The Global Wealth Pyramid", "body": "The level of financial inequality around the world is staggering.

So: is the world becoming less democratic?One way to approach this question is to look at the evolution of both democratic societies and autocratic regimes around the world. In our chart, we have drawn from the classification and evaluation of political regimes shown by Our World in Data (L\u00fchrmann et al. (2018), V-Dem). Here, democracies have been subdivided into two categories, \u201celectoral\u201d and \u201cliberal\u201d. Liberal democracies hold not only free elections but also have equitable laws and processes.Using this data, we can see that democracy has indeed been on the decline in recent years. After an all-time high in 2016, when there were 97 democracies worldwide (both in terms of liberal and electoral), this figure fell to 89 in 2021. The number of people living in democracies has plummeted from 3.9 billion in 2017 to 2.3 billion in 2021.

In the 2021 survey, the two countries recorded the two highest scores in the world on the index, which is based on people's daily experiences of sadness, stress, worry, anger and physical pain. Higher scores on the index mean more of a population is experiencing these emotions.As summarized by Gallup, \"most of the countries with the highest scores on the Negative Experience Index were contending with some type of economic or political instability in 2021\".

Between 2017 and 2021, the regions of the world that lost the largest share of people via emigration were the Marshall Islands and American Samoa in the Pacific Ocean, followed by Lebanon and Venezuela. During this period, these four territories, some of which are experiencing severe economic hardship, experienced an average net loss of 28 to 42 inhabitants per 1,000 people per year.In contrast, the regions that attracted the most migrants relative to their population size were the New Zealand-administered Tokelau Archipelago, the Caribbean tax haven of the Turks and Caicos Islands and, in Europe, Malta.
